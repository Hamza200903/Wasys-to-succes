<h3>Future plan to become president </h3>
<p><i>I am Hamza who is gonna be the best <strong>robotic engineer</strong> in the world later on in the future in order to help Pakistan become developed very quickly. Once i will get enough fame by the people of Pakistan and enough money i will run for the president of Pakistan and make every ones lives easier by giving every one a free robot to help them in their daily lives.</i></p>
<hr size="3" noshade>
<h3> How i will fullfill my dream</h3>
<p>The way i will complete my mission is by learning the stuff like 
    <ul>
  <li>coding</li>  
  <li>engineering</li>
</ul>
    basically the things i need to learn to become a robotics engineer.<ol> <li>Once i have learned all this, i will then work in a company to earn some money, then i will invest a bit of my money on buying a car, then rest on a house in the US to live.</li>
    <br><li> Now i wont have to worry about living any where so i will then work in an other company and get promoted to CEO. Now i would start to earn a lot of money so i will start making my own products and post videos of them to earn money from youtube at the same time.</li><br> <li> Once i start earning enough money i will quit my job and start my own company and get sone employees to work with me and slowly i will recruit more people make an exhibition of robots ant prototypes.</li><br> <li>Once we have our products ready at least 3 i will start selling them first at low prices then new ones at higher prices and in a new few years i will become rich and i will also get pretty famous in the entire world.</li><br><li>When i go back to Pakistan i will run for president and give every one a free robot the third model, this encourage the people to buy the older versions and i will run evenmore money as the president there fore if any one else becomes the president i will live my life happily.</li></ol>
